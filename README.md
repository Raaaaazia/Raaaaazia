# About Me
## Hi there, I am Raazia!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on automating the discovery of university research partners using semantic search and agentic AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning, large language models, and AI engineering tools like Hugging Face, FAISS, and Ollama.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source ML projects and university-industry research tools.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with fine-tuning LLMs for better academic text understanding and improving semantic search pipelines.
- 💬 Ask me about my “Professor in a Haystack” project, vector embeddings, or how I use APIs and LLMs together for research discovery.
- 📫 How to reach me: (mailto:raamir@owu.edu) or on [LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raazia-aamir-0a8bab2bb?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3Bq52kTGmFT0q9BLMcDzvQUg%3D%3D))
